//! This simple example problem for IDA, due to Robertson, is from chemical kinetics, and consists
//! of the following three equations:
//!
//!      dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.e4*y2*y3
//!      dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.e4*y2*y3 - 3.e7*y2**2
//!         0   = y1 + y2 + y3 - 1
//!
//! on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.e10, with initial conditions: y1 = 1, y2 = y3 = 0.
//!
//! While integrating the system, we also use the rootfinding feature to find the points at which
//! y1 = 1e-4 or at which y3 = 0.01.
//!
//! The problem is solved with IDA using the DENSE linear solver, with a user-supplied Jacobian.
//! Output is printed at t = .4, 4, 40, ..., 4e10.
